# Data Directory

This folder should contain the dataset for **Histopathologic Cancer Detection**.

## ðŸ”¹ How to Get the Dataset
Due to file size constraints, the dataset is **not included in this repo**. You must download it manually.

### Option 1: Download from Kaggle
1. Go to [Kaggle Dataset Page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data).
2. Download `train.zip`, `test.zip`, and `train_labels.csv`.
3. Extract them into the `data/` folder.

Expected structure:
```bash
data/
â”œâ”€â”€ train/                 # Training images
â”œâ”€â”€ test/                  # Test images
â”œâ”€â”€ train_labels.csv        # Labels for training images
```

### Option 2: Use the Kaggle API
Run:
```sh
python scripts/download_data.py
```

Now the dataset is ready to use!

# Models Directory

This folder contains **trained model weights** in `.h5` format.

## ðŸ“‚ Available Models
| Model File               | Description                         |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `efficientnet_model.h5`  | EfficientNetV2S trained model      |
| `vit_hybrid_model.h5`    | Vision Transformer Hybrid model    |

## ðŸ”¹ How to Use These Models
To load a saved model in TensorFlow:
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Load EfficientNet
model = load_model("models/efficientnet_model.h5")

# Load ViT-Hybrid
vit_model = load_model("models/vit_hybrid_model.h5")
```
